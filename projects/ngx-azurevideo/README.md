## Overfiew

To use this component, you must first [upload a video to media services, encode it, and get a streaming endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/media-serviceslatest/manage-assets-quickstart).

MSFT has a cool demo of the AMP player here [AmpDEMO](https://ampdemo.azureedge.net/azuremediaplayer.html)
